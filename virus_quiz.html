    options:[
      {k:'a', text:"Check the gas station nearby for bottled water (risky, public place).", score:3, explanation:"Gas stations can have supplies but are high risk — useful if quick and stealthy."},

      {k:'c', text:"Inspect your car and emergency kit for spare water.", score:4, explanation:"Cars often hide useful supplies — good quick option if vehicle is intact."},
      {k:'d', text:"Leave buckets outside and pray for rain.", score:1, explanation:"Relying on rain is unreliable and wastes precious time when immediate action is needed."},
      {k:'e', text:"Boil local lake/pond water and treat it (if you have capability).", score:5, explanation:"Treating local water is strong when you can boil/filter — sustainable and practical."},

      {k:'c', text:"Send one person to meet them outside while others stand guard.", score:3, explanation:"Sending a single representative balances caution and outreach, but is risky."},
      {k:'d', text:"Refuse outright and prepare to defend (no negotiation).", score:1, explanation:"Hostility cuts off possible help and can escalate conflict unnecessarily."},
      {k:'e', text:"Offer to trade food at a distance in exchange for medicine and call it a day.", score:5, explanation:"Controlled trade at distance is practical and keeps risk lower."},

      {k:'c', text:"Make noise to draw them away from the house then sneak out.", score:0, explanation:"Attracting a fast horde is almost always disastrous — very poor choice."},
